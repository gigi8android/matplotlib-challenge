# matplotlib-challenge

The submission is included: jupyter notebook (scrap_pymaceutical_final.ipynb), subfolder called "data" with input data files and readme (this file).

Observations based on the output & graphs:

1 - The number of mice participated in the tests is quite evenly distributed between male and female.

2 - There is an outlier in the boxplot for Infubinol regimen. The outlier indicates that there is a big spread in the data of the tumor size for mice that had been tested with Infubinol regimen. The statistics table also shows that the minimum tumor size is 36.321346(mm3), the maximum value is 72.226731(mm3) and the midpoint distribution (i.e. the median) is 60.165180(mm3). Potentially there was an error in data collection that caused such outlier.

3 - The correlation coefficent value of tested mice for Capolin is is about 0.88 (near 1). This indicates that their is a strong positive relationship between the mouse weight and the tumor size. 

4 - In the four selected drugs - Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin; Ceftamin has the highest IQR and lowest whiskers which means that its data are quite consistent and hence the test outcomes are more reliable.
